Python Assorted code
====================

Miscellaneous Python code snippets and experiments.

## Running

```
make shell
```

And then from inside the Python 3.7 container install and run whatever you want.

**Note**: Only basic `python 3.7`, `pytest` and `flake8` are installed.


### Miscellaneous
* `\double-linked-list`: A Python implementation of a double linked list, with sorting, reversing, item flipping and inserting at specific position (by data).
* `\list_search.py`: Old search prototype for a command-line provided string in all txt files of folder where script is launched. Sample text files format:
```
0   /media/kartones/pre1/test 1/blablabla
123 /media/kartones/pre1/test 1/blablabla2
0   /media/kartones/pre1/test 1
0   /media/kartones/pre1/test 2/blablabla
0   /media/kartones/pre1/test.1/blablabla
```
* `\markov-model`: An implementation of a simple Markov model (a Markov Chain) for generating variants of sentences based on a text.
* `\mastodon-purge`: Script to delete your Mastodon toots older than X days (5 with sample config). Best setup as a cron job to run hourly or daily.
* `\pelican\plugins`: Some plugins I've built for the Pelican static site generator tool.
* `\pelican\blogengine_to_pelican.py`: Tool to migrate from BlogEngine.Net to Pelican (posts and pages).
* `\pelican\publisher`: Tool to allow post-processing of Pelican builds and optionally upload a post via FTP.
* `\shopping-cart-with-discounts`: Tiny implementation of a shopping cart with an extensible discounts system.
* `\trello-backup`: **(No longer works)** Script to export your Trello boards as json files, plus all attachments. One folder per board with data inside.
* `\twitter-purge`: Script to delete your Twitter tweets older than X days (5 with sample config). Best setup as a cron job to run hourly or daily.
* `\weather-email`: **(No longer works)** Small script that fetches Madrid's current weather info and sends it via email. Perfect to be setup as a cron job at 7AM to remind me daily of the weather before I head out for work.
