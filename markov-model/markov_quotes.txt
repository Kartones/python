Be the change you want to see in this world
Jack of all trades, master of none
Try to learn something about everything, and everything about something
Do what is right, not what is easy
Prioritize principles over process
Everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing it

Done is better than perfect

Keep it simple, Make it valuable, Build it piece by piece
Work hard and go home
Hope is not a strategy
Don’t teach students what to think; teach them how to think
If you look at the code you made one year ago and you don't feel ashamed, you're doing it wrong because you're not improving

Wisdom is not transferred, it is learned
Fortune favors the prepared mind
An error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation, nor does truth become error because nobody sees it

To know, is to know that you know nothing, that is the meaning of true knowledge
The fastest code is the code that never runs
We are tomorrow's past
Everything a person can imagine, others will do
Build exciting things with boring technologies
The purpose of software engineering is to control complexity, not to create it
Seek first to understand, then to be understood
A mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if it is not open
Believe those who seek the truth, doubt those who find it
If you do what you love, and do it as well as you can, good things will eventually come of it, ot necessarily quickly or easily, but if you stick with it, they will come
Keep it simple until you can't
